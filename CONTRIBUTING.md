git checkout -b docs/update-readme
```

### 3. Make Your Changes

- Follow the existing code style
- Add comments for complex logic
- Update tests if applicable
- Update documentation if needed

### 4. Test Your Changes

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Run type checking
npx tsc --noEmit

# Test your changes manually
npm run dev
```

### 5. Commit Your Changes

Follow our commit message guidelines (see below).

### 6. Push Your Branch

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 7. Create a Pull Request

- Go to your fork on GitHub
- Click "New Pull Request"
- Select your branch
- Fill out the PR template
- Submit the PR

## Branch Naming Convention

Use descriptive branch names that indicate the type of change:

### Format
```
<type>/<description>
```

### Types

- **feature/**: New features or enhancements
  - `feature/user-dashboard`
  - `feature/thumbnail-history`
  - `feature/credit-system`

- **fix/**: Bug fixes
  - `fix/auth-redirect-issue`
  - `fix/image-generation-error`
  - `fix/database-connection`

- **docs/**: Documentation updates
  - `docs/api-documentation`
  - `docs/setup-guide`
  - `docs/contributing-guide`

- **refactor/**: Code refactoring
  - `refactor/auth-middleware`
  - `refactor/database-queries`
  - `refactor/ui-components`

- **test/**: Adding or updating tests
  - `test/user-authentication`
  - `test/image-generation`
  - `test/api-endpoints`

- **chore/**: Maintenance tasks
  - `chore/update-dependencies`
  - `chore/cleanup-unused-code`
  - `chore/update-config`

### Examples of Good Branch Names

‚úÖ **Good:**
- `feature/thumbnail-preview-modal`
- `fix/google-oauth-redirect-loop`
- `docs/api-endpoints-documentation`
- `refactor/prisma-client-setup`
- `test/user-credit-system`

‚ùå **Bad:**
- `new-stuff`
- `fix`
- `updates`
- `changes`
- `feature`

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

### Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

### Examples

```bash
feat(auth): add Google OAuth integration
fix(api): resolve image generation timeout issue
docs(readme): update setup instructions
refactor(ui): extract reusable button component
test(auth): add unit tests for login flow
chore(deps): update Next.js to version 15.5.3
```

### Commit Message Best Practices

- Use the imperative mood ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Capitalize the first letter
- Don't end with a period
- Use the body to explain what and why, not how
- Reference issues in the footer: `Fixes #123`

## Pull Request Guidelines

### PR Title Format
```
<type>: <description>
```

Examples:
- `feat: Add thumbnail preview modal`
- `fix: Resolve Google OAuth redirect loop`
- `docs: Update API documentation`
